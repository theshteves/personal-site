### Inspiration

At the apex of meme-based hackathons, Uncommon Hacks and the greater hacker community around the University of Chicago inspired us to contribute back to what we believe is the most strange yet nostalgic aspect of Internet Culture.  With an unusual variety of prizes guiding our way, we built the most entertaining platform conceivable to explore gifs.

### About

On page load, you will be greated by a search prompt in front of what we believe to be the most beautiful layout.  With the tap of a button, you can sit back and enjoy our platform's distinct audio-visual experience.  

We hope you enjoy experiencing it as much as we enjoyed building it!
